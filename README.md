# My ABAP Theme
This theme has different foreground colors for 'Read-only' and 'Edit mode'. 'Read-only' has a pure black foreground and 'Edit mode' has a slightly lighter black foreground. A lot of themes you find online do not include a seperate forground for 'Read-only' (like the OEM SAP themes), and this can sometimes be frustrating.

Read-only:
